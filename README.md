# Price_Is_Right
A computer science 1 project in C++

The project is a C++ project based on using do While and conditional statements to create a "The Price is Right game". The user will be given a random prize picture. After their first guess they will have 30 seconds to guess the correct price. After each guess the user will be prompted to guess higher or lower based on the their guess and the relative random price. After the user guesses correctly or the timer runs out, the user may play again.

This is a basic program used to reiterate the foundations of while loops, random numbers, and conditional statements.
